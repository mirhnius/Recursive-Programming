# Recursive-Programming
This repository includes three problems of the Advanced Programming course implemented by Recursive Programming in C++.

 * ***Program_1.cpp:***
The functionality of this program is changing numbers in base 6 to base 10 in a Recursive manner.

* ***Program_2.cpp:***
The functionality of this program is inversign the elements of an array in a Recursive manner.

* ***Program_3.cpp:***
Minesweeper is a one-person puzzle game. The goal of the game is to find mines in a rectangular map. We assign a number to each house, which indicates the number of mines in 8 houses adjacent to that house. These numbers are hidden from the user. The user can click on a house to get the numbers of the surrounding houses. After clicking on a house from the map, the numbers of the houses will appear until they reach a natural number or the walls of the map.
